$1+1$
$$1+1$$

$$\|\mathbf{x}\|_{2}=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2}}$$

[[1+1]]

* $$p(\theta|X_1, . . . ,X_n)$$

??????

Fixed for now by adding
```
gem 'kramdown', '<= 2.1'
```
in Gemfile
Seems it has something to do with the recent kramdown update https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/commit/c3acf8df1db49d2456050f4456f3f542294e2e8f where kramdown no longer wrap formulas into tags anymore. 
This is just a temporary solution, as github warns

> The kramdown gem before 2.3.0 for Ruby processes the template option inside Kramdown documents by default, which allows unintended read access (such as template="/etc/passwd") or unintended embedded Ruby code execution (such as a string that begins with template="string://<%= `). NOTE: kramdown is used in Jekyll, GitLab Pages, GitHub Pages, and Thredded Forum.

Looking forward to a better solution.
