Husky or Wolf? Classified by background: snow->wolf, no snow->husky.  
Pneumonia? Classified by hospital token.  
Clever Hans.

Test on independent and identically distributed(i.i.d.) images->Test on out of distribution(o.o.d.) images.

(1) Connecting the dots: shortcut learning is ubiquitous  
(2) Interpreting results carefully  
(3) Testing o.o.d. generalisation  
(4) Understanding what makes a solution easy to learn
